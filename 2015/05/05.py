#  - It contains at least three vowels (aeiou only), like aei, xazegov, or
#    aeiouaeiouaeiou.
#  - It contains at least one letter that appears twice in a row, like xx,
#    abcdde (dd), or aabbccdd (aa, bb, cc, or dd).
#  - It does not contain the strings ab, cd, pq, or xy, even if they are part
#    of one of the other requirements.

#    them, like xyx, abcdefeghi (efe), or even aaa.
